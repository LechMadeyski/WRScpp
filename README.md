======

This package provides C++ sub-routines for several iterative procedures in the [R package `WRS`](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/wrs/) for robust statistics by [Rand Wilcox](http://dornsife.usc.edu/cf/labs/wilcox/wilcox-faculty-display.cfm). These sub-routines provide substantial performance boosts.
